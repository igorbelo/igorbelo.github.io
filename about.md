My name is Igor Belo and I’m a software developer living in Brazil and this is my blog.

I am on this since I was 15-year-old, building an website every week. I’m interested in Ruby, Python, Elixir, Elasticsearch and Postgres.

I hope my articles serve to me as knowledge documentation and help some devs somehow.
